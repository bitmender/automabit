 Automabits


This is a *personal* project (Read: not production ready... but ready for feedback to continually improve.)


*** RVM Install is currently note setup to match install notes below ***


For the brave/foolish at heart:

curl -L https://raw.github.com/bitmender/automabit/master/first_swing.sh | bash

(Alternatively, download https://raw.github.com/bitmender/automabit/master/first_swing.sh, review file and execute with bash). 


Running first_swing.sh on a *fresh* Ubuntu-ish install should bootstrap all packages and settings necessary to get the automabit functional. 

Afterwards the following thor tasks should be available (assuming you clone/install these tasks):



system
------
thor system:install     # use sudo apt-get to install system package
thor system:update_all  # apt-get update, upgrade, and dist-upgrade

vim
---
thor vim:add_bundle LOCATION  # install a vim plugin gfrom given git location
thor vim:add_git_support      # add git fugitive support
thor vim:add_rails_support    # add rails.vim support
thor vim:create_vimrc         # create ~/.vimrc with template
thor vim:setup                # install and setup vim to use pathogen

Basic Steps in getting thor installed on barebones ubuntu.

1.) Install RVM dependencies (curl, git)
2.) Install RVM
3.) Append RVM created .bash_login to .profile, rm .bash_login (This seems like a tricky bug.... .profile takes precedence over .bash_login so .bash_login never gets called.  Is there any potential harm in us moving over to the .profile? - none personally experienced.)
4.) Install ruby instance (latest by default)
5.) create and use rvm gemset
6.) gem install thor
7.) thor list to see avail tasks
